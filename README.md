> Tailify's very own opinionated Babel preset for React.

## Installation

```
$ npm install --save-dev @tailify/babel-preset-react
```

## Usage

To get started, add this to your `.babelrc.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
  presets: ['@tailify/react']
};
```

*Note: We can omit the `/babel-preset` suffix since it is automatically assumed by Babel.*
